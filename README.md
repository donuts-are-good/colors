## 🥳 Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/donuts-are-good/colors"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(colors.BrightGreen + "'Oh, I beg your pardon!'" + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.BrightYellow + "cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings." + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.BrightCyan + "She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof." + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.Magenta + "There were doors all round the hall," + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.Red + "but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other," + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.BrightMagenta + "trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again." + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.Yellow + "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table," + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.BrightBlue + "all made of solid glass;" + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.BrightRed + "there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key," + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.Green + "and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;" + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.BrightBlack + "but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small," + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.BrightPurple + "but at any rate it would not open any of them." + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.BrightWhite + "However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain" + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.Black + "she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high:" + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.Cyan + "she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!" + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.White + "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage," + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.Purple + "not much larger than a rat-hole:" + colors.NC)
	fmt.Println(colors.Blue + "she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw." + colors.NC)
}
